# taproject
This is the final repo for my tinyapp project.  There are very few commits as there were server issues with express introduced as well as confusion around code improvements and git branches.

Dependencies are as follows:
- express
- ejs
- cookie-session
- body-parser
- bcrypt



The main functionality for a logged in user is that they can edit and delete their own URLs:
